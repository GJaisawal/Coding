              That are based on a request/response design.

Important Terms : 

1. Client : 

A client is a person or program using the API. The client makes requests to the API to retrieve some information or change something
within the application.Your web browser is a client — it interacts with APIs different websites to get page content from them.
The requested info is sent back to your browser and displayed on your screen.

2. Resource : 

A resource is any piece of information that the API can provide the client. For instance, a resource in Facebook’s API could be 
a user, a page, a photo, or a post. Each resource has a unique name, called the resource identifier.

A server is used by the application that receives client requests and contains resources that the client wants. The server has an
API to interact with clients without giving them direct access to content stored in its database.
